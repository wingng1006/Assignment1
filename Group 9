    "Generally the ANN performs decently. However, it also takes very long to train. We first started with smaller models with less hidden layers and nodes. However, it did not perform well and with time we realized that more nodes and hidden layers improved performance but it also increases computational time. Simple Grid Search for 6 points took multiple hours. This severly limited the tuning possible. When evaluating the performance we could see that the ANN tended to overfit, giving a much higher F1 score after tuning than on the testing data. To counter this we increased the penalty (alpha). Additionally, we would in the future also decrease the number of nodes and hidden layers again to create a sparser network and find a balance between fitting and overfitting. In the end, we believe there would still be a lot potential in the ANN which we unfortunately could not leverage due to time and computational power constraints. "
